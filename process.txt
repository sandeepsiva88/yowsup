Update the packages with.

Prepare the system with the necessary components to Yowsup.

sudo apt-get install python-dateutil
sudo apt-get install python-setuptools

sudo apt-get install libevent-dev
sudo apt-get install ncurses-dev
Download the library with the command.

git clone git://github.com/jlguardi/yowsup
Navigate to the folder.

cd yowsup
And install the library with the command.

sudo python setup.py install
note if error occured here with something like disable-jpeg

write the following command

sudo apt-get install 
Then run setup again.

After installing the library we have to register the device to use WhatsApp.

First you need to request a registration code.

python yowsup-cli registration --requestcode sms --phone 39xxxxxxxxxx --cc 39 --mcc 222 --mnc 10
you can find your specific country code , mcc , mnc online from this link :

http://www.mcc-mnc.com

and replace the command with your data then You should receive on your phone a sms message with a code like xxx-xxx

Send a message to request registration with this command, (replace xxx-xxx with code you received)

python yowsup-cli registration --register xxx-xxx --phone 39xxxxxxxxxx --cc 39
If all goes well, we should get a message like this

status: ok
kind: free
pw: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx=
price: € 0,89
price_expiration: 1416553637
currency: EUR
cost: 0.89
expiration: 1445241022
login: 39xxxxxxxxxxx
type: existing
Warning

WhatsApp requires the registration of a number, and with that number you can use WhatsApp on only one device at a time

WhatsApp can be used on one device at a time and if you will make many attempts to register the number, it could be banned.

Create a file to save your credentials.

sudo nano /home/pi/yowsup/config
With this content.

## Actual config starts below ##
cc=39 #if not specified it will be autodetected
phone=39xxxxxxxxxx
password=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx=
Ok, we're ready for the test, Yowsup has a demo application in /home/pi/yowsup/yowsup/demos

Navigate to yowsup folder.

cd /home/pi/yowsup
Start yowsup-cli demos with the command.

yowsup-cli demos --yowsup --config config
You can see Yowsup prompt.

If type "/help" you can see all available commands.

First use the '/L' command for login; to send a message type.

/message send 39xxxxxxxxxx "This is a message sent from Raspberry Pi"
Replace xxx with the recipient number

And IT WORKED
